# 💖 Will You Be My Valentine?

**Reviewer / Crusher / Future-Partner Approver ✅**

Hey you! Yes, YOU! 🫵

Are you trying to steal this code to win over your crush?  
Are you planning to deploy this and take all the credit for the cute floating hearts and the typing effect? 🤨

**THAT'S TOTALLY FINE!** (I gotchu basic lover).

## 🛑 BUT WAIT! A Humble Request...

Before you `git clone` this masterpiece and run off into the sunset...

### 👉 **GIVE THIS REPO A STAR! ⭐** 👈

**Why?**
- Because if you don't, the "NO" button might actually start working. (Spooky, right? 👻)
- Because bad karma is real, and you don't want your proposal to fail because you didn't click one button.
- Because it makes me happy. 🥺

## ✨ Features
- **Un-clickable "NO" Button**: It literally runs away. Like your ex. (Too soon?) 🏃‍♂️
- **Keyboard Typing Effect**: Makes it look like you poured your soul into writing the question. ⌨️
- **Success Celebration**: Confetti! Bears hugging! Pure dopamine! 🎉
- **Custom Cursor**: Because standard pointers are boring. 💘
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works on phones too, because let's be real, you're sending this on WhatsApp. 📱
